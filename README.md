# Astro with Decap CMS Local Setup

This is a minimal Astro install running Netlify's Decap CMS with a local configuration. This means you can test this locally to understand how it works.

## How to run
Open a terminal and type `npx decap-server` this is required in order to avoid the required login to the CMS locally.

Then open a separate terminal and run you node app separately.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```


## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
